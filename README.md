let's integrate Docker persistent volumes (pv) and a Docker network to enhance the setup:

1. **Create Docker Volumes**:
   - Create Docker volumes for both frontend and backend to persist data if needed. For example:

     ```
     docker volume create frontend-data
     docker volume create backend-data
     ```

2. **Containerize the Frontend**:
   - Assuming you have a Dockerfile for the frontend as mentioned before, you can use the same commands to build the frontend image.

Build the frontend image:

docker build -t frontend-dockerfile .

3. **Containerize the Backend**:
   - Similarly, assuming you have a Dockerfile for the backend as mentioned before, you can use the same commands to build the backend image.


Build the backend image:

docker build -t backend-dockerfile .

4. **Compose the Docker Infrastructure with Docker Network**:
   - Create a Docker network:

     ```
     docker network create my-network
     ```

   - Update your `deployment.yml` file to include volume mounts and network configurations:

    

5. **Orchestrate with Docker Compose**:
   - Use Docker Compose to spin up the containers:

     ```
     deployment up
     ```

6. **Test the Deployment**:
   - Test your application as before to ensure everything is functioning correctly. Now, data generated or modified within the containers should persist across container restarts due to the volume mounts.

7. **Monitor and Manage**:
   - Utilize Docker commands like `docker ps`, `docker logs`, and `docker-compose down` for monitoring and managing your containers, as mentioned before.

By incorporating Docker persistent volumes and a Docker network, you enhance the reliability and scalability of your two-tier application deployment.
